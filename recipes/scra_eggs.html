		<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>

		<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!
</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
			<li>9 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
			<li>olive oil</li>
			<li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture.</li>
			<li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until oil starts to shimmer. Pour egg mixture into hot oil and cook, without stirring, for 5 seconds.</li>
			<li>Cook and stir egg mixture until eggs are scrambled and softly set, about 30 seconds. Transfer eggs to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
		</ol>
